, this research introduces a new technology connected with the E-Channelling System, which is an IoT Medical Device. This research contains two main components, such as: IoT Device and the E-Channelling Web Application. IoT Medical Device is designed to use by the patients. To make appointment with the doctors, the patients have to login to E-Channelling Web Application. After the response for the appointment by the doctor, the patient can connect with the doctor through the web application. The IoT device is connected with the web application for each user. Also, the IoT device contains some sensors for patient to measure their health data. The sensors are heart rate, temperature sensors and etc. Measured data are transmitted to web application through WIFI and the doctors are able to view the updated data in real-time. This system helps to transmit real health data between the doctor and the patient. So that, the doctor can provide proper medical prescriptions other than just giving medical suggestions.
